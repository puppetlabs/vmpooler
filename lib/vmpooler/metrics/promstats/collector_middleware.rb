# This is an adapted Collector module for vmpooler based on the sample implementation
# available in the prometheus client_ruby library
# https://github.com/prometheus/client_ruby/blob/master/lib/prometheus/middleware/collector.rb
#
# The code was also failing Rubocop on PR check, so have addressed all the offenses.
#
# The method strip_hostnames_from_path (originally strip_ids_from_path) has been adapted
# to add a match for hostnames in paths # to replace with a single ":hostname" string to
# avoid # proliferation of stat lines for # each new vm hostname deleted, modified or
# otherwise queried.

      # CollectorMiddleware is an implementation of Rack Middleware customised
      # for vmpooler use.
      #
      # By default metrics are registered on the global registry. Set the
      # `:registry` option to use a custom registry.
      #
      # By default metrics all have the prefix "http_server". Set to something
      # else if you like.
      #
      # The request counter metric is broken down by code, method and path by
      # default. Set the `:counter_label_builder` option to use a custom label
      # builder.
      #
      # The request duration metric is broken down by method and path by default.
      # Set the `:duration_label_builder` option to use a custom label builder.
      #
      # Label Builder functions will receive a Rack env and a status code, and must
      # return a hash with the labels for that request. They must also accept an empty
      # env, and return a hash with the correct keys. This is necessary to initialize
      # the metrics with the correct set of labels.
