:providers:
# :providers:
#
# This section contains the VM providers for VMs and Pools
# The currently supported backing services are:
# - vsphere
# - dummy
#
#   - provider_class
#     For multiple providers, specify one of the supported backing services (vsphere or dummy)
#     (optional: will default to it's parent :key: name eg. 'vsphere')
#
#   - purge_unconfigured_folders
#     Enable purging of VMs and folders detected within the base folder path that are not configured for the provider
#     Only a single layer of folders and their child VMs are evaluated from detected base folder paths
#     Nested child folders will not be destroyed. An optional whitelist can be provided to exclude folders
#     A base folder path for 'vmpooler/redhat-7' would be 'vmpooler'
#     Setting this on the provider will enable folder purging for the provider
#     Expects a boolean value
#     (optional; default: false)
#
#   - folder_whitelist
#     Specify folders that are within the base folder path, not in the configuration, and should not be destroyed
#     To exclude 'vmpooler/myfolder' from being destroyed when the base path is 'vmpooler' you would specify 'myfolder' in the whitelist
#     This option is only evaluated when 'purge_unconfigured_folders' is enabled
#     Expects an array of strings specifying the whitelisted folders by name
#     (optional; default: nil)
#
# If you want to support more than one provider with different parameters (server, username or passwords) you have to specify the
# backing service in the provider_class configuration parameter for example 'vsphere' or 'dummy'. Each pool can specify
# the provider to use.
#

#     The number of concurrent VM creation tasks to perform for ondemand VM requests.
#     (default: 10)
#
#   - timeout
#     How long (in minutes) before marking a clone in 'pending' queues as 'failed' and retrying.
#     (default: 15)
#

#     How often (in minutes) to check the sanity of VMs in 'ready' queues.
#     (default: 1)
#
#   - vm_lifetime
#     How long (in hours) to keep VMs in 'running' queues before destroying.
#     (optional; default: '24')
#
#   - vm_lifetime_auth
#     Same as vm_lifetime, but applied if a valid authentication token is
#     included during the request.
#
#   - allowed_tags
#     If set, restricts tags to those specified in this array.
#
#   - domain
#     If set, returns a top-level 'domain' JSON key in POST requests
#
#   - prefix
#     If set, prefixes all created VMs with this string.  This should include
#     a separator.
#     (optional; default: '')
#
#   - migration_limit (Only affects vSphere Provider)
#     When set to any value greater than 0 enable VM migration at checkout.
#     When enabled this capability will evaluate a VM for migration to a different host when it is requested
#     in an effort to maintain a more even distribution of load across compute resources.
#     The migration_limit ensures that no more than the specified migrations will take place at any one time.
#
#   - max_tries
#     Set the max number of times a connection should retry in VM providers.
#     This optional setting allows a user to dial in retry limits to
#     suit your environment.
#     (optional; default: 3)
#
#   - retry_factor
#     When retrying, each attempt sleeps for the try count * retry_factor.
#     Increase this number to lengthen the delay between retry attempts.
#     This is particularly useful for instances with a large number of pools
#     to prevent a thundering herd when retrying connections.
#     (optional; default: 10)
#
#   - check_loop_delay_min (optional; default: 5) seconds
#   - check_loop_delay_max (optional; default: 60) seconds
#   - check_loop_delay_decay (optional; default: 2.0) Must be greater than 1.0
#     Each pool is polled on a schedule to check whether there are any tasks to perform, for example, provision
#     new VMs to fill a pool, or destroy VMs which are no longer required. By default this value is every 5 seconds.
#     However, with a large number of pools, this can cause the provider to be issuing many, many requests which
#     can cause performance problems, for example, vSphere recommends no more than 100 active connections per vCenter
#     instance. But if you increase the check interval to a large number, then vmpooler will appear to be slow to
#     perform tasks.  These settings can be used to tune how often the provider is polling for changes to a pool.
#     This is done by increasing the polling period when the pool is stable or when unimportant tasks are being
#     performed.  The polling period is decreased back to the minimum when important tasks happen (newly discovered VMs,
#     creating new VMs and checking for VMs that have completed cloning but not ready).  This means the pools are
#     checked appropriately during important events, but as the pool stabilizes it does not need to be checked as often.
#       - The check_loop_delay_min setting determines the smallest period of time between polls, in seconds.
#       - The check_loop_delay_max setting determines the longest period of time between polls, in seconds.
#         Must be greater than or equal to check_loop_delay_min or it will be set to check_loop_delay_min.
#       - The check_loop_delay_decay setting determines how quickly the delay moves from minimum to maximum. So a value
#         of 2.0 means each time the pool is checked and nothing important happens, the loop delay is multiplied by 2.0,
#         for example, the first time is 2 seconds, then 4, 8, 16 etc. until it reaches check_loop_delay_max.
#         This value must be greater than 1.0.
#
#   - manage_host_selection (Only affects vSphere Provider)
#     Allow host selection to be determined by vmpooler
#     Hosts are selected based on current CPU utilization and cycled between when there are multiple targets
#     The hosts tracking list is refreshed on an interval when a host is requested determined by host_selection_max_age
#     (optional; default: false)
#
#   - create_folders (Only affects vSphere Provider)
#     Create the pool folder specified in the pool configuration
#     Note: this will only create the last folder when it does not exist. It will not create any parent folders
#     (optional; default: false)
#
#   - create_template_delta_disks (Only affects vSphere Provider)
#     Create backing delta disks for the specified templates to support creating linked clones.
#     (optional; default: false)
#
#   - host_selection_max_age (Only affects vSphere Provider)
#     The maximum age of the provider_hosts list in seconds
#     The list is repopulated when the difference between now and the last time
#     checking of host utilization finished is greater than the value set.
#     (optional; default: 60)
#
#   - utilization_limit (Only affects vSphere Provider)
#     The maximum utilization of host resources allowed before the host
#     is excluded from consideration for VM deployment
#     The value represents a percentage and applies to both memory and CPU
#     (optional; default: 90)
#
#   - experimental_features (Only affects API config endpoints)
#     Enable experimental API capabilities such as changing pool template and size without application restart
#     Expects a boolean value
#     (optional; default: false)
#
#   - purge_unconfigured_folders (vSphere Provider only)
#     Enable purging of VMs and folders detected within the base folder path that are not configured for the provider
#     Only a single layer of folders and their child VMs are evaluated from detected base folder paths
#     A base folder path for 'vmpooler/redhat-7' would be 'vmpooler'
#     When enabled in the global configuration then purging is enabled for all providers
#     Expects a boolean value
#     (optional; default: false)
#
#   - backend_weight
#     A hash of clone_target values with weights assigned to allow selecting VMs by alias with selection probability
#     This setting is only used when there is a pool title and matching alias that both have values set in backend weight.
#     When both conditions are met then the next VM is selected by probability using backend weight. When weight is not set
#     in this configuration then distribution of load is random.
#     Expects a hash value
#     (optional)
#
#   - usage_stats
#     Enable shipping of VM usage stats
#     When enabled a metric is emitted when a machine is destroyed. Tags are inspected and used to organize
#     shipped metrics if there is a jenkins_build_url tag set for the VM.
#     Without the jenkins_build_url tag set the metric will be sent as "usage.$user.$pool_name".
#     When the jenkins_build_url tag is set the metric will be sent with additional data. Here is an example
#     based off of the following URL, and requested by the user ABS;
#     https://jenkins.example.com/job/platform_puppet-agent-extra_puppet-agent-integration-suite_pr/RMM_COMPONENT_TO_TEST_NAME=puppet,SLAVE_LABEL=beaker,TEST_TARGET=redhat7-64a/824/
#     "usage.$user.$instance.$value_stream.$branch.$project.$job_name.$component_to_test.$pool_name", which translates to
#     "usage.$user.jenkins_example_com.platform.pr.puppet-agent-extra.puppet-agent-integration-suite.puppet.$pool_name"
#     Expects a boolean value
#     (optional; default: false)
#
#   - request_logger
#     Enable API Request logging to the logger
#     When enabled all requests to the API are written to the standard logger.
#     Expects a boolean value
#     (optional; default: false)
#
#   - max_lifetime_upper_limit
#     Sets a lifetime upper limit (in hours) for how long the vm lifetime can be set via the API. Lifetime can be set and extended
#     so this configuration is used to enforce an upper limit to both the initial lifetime request and/or the extended
#     lifetime (by checking how long it has already been running).
#     (optional; default: unlimited)
#
#   - extra_config
#     Specify additional application configuration files
#     The argument can accept a full path to a file, or multiple files comma separated.
#     Expects a string value
#     (optional)
#
#   - max_ondemand_instances_per_request
#     The maximum number of instances any individual ondemand request may contain per pool.
#     (default: 10)
#
#   - ondemand_request_ttl
#     The amount of time (in minutes) to give for a ondemand request to be fulfilled before considering it to have failed.
#     (default: 5)
#
#   - ready_ttl
#     How long (in minutes) a ready VM should stay in the ready queue.
#     (default: 60)
#
# Example:

:config: site_name: 'vmpooler'
  logfile: '/var/log/vmpooler.log'
  task_limit: 10
  timeout: 15
